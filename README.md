# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project uses a machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical features. The model is built using Python with popular data science libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, and is trained on the publicly available heart.csv dataset.
