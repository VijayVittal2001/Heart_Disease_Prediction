**# Heart_Disease_Prediction**
This project uses a machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical features. The model is built using Python with popular data science libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, and is trained on the publicly available heart.csv dataset.

The dataset contains clinical information of patients, including.
age, sex, cp (chest pain type)
trestbps (resting blood pressure)
chol (cholesterol level)
fbs (fasting blood sugar)
restecg, thalach, exang, oldpeak, slope, ca, thal
target (0 = No heart disease, 1 = Heart disease)
